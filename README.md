## Description
 As a developer my goal is to build a CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. The app will follow the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Usage 
``express handlebars``
 ``MYSQL2``
``Sequalize packages`` 
``.env package``
``bycript package`` 
``express sessions``
